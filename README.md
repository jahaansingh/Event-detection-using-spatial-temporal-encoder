Autoencoders are neural networks that are trained to reconstruct the input. The autoencoder consists of two parts:
<li>The encoder: Capable of learning efficient representations of the input data (x) called the encoding f(x). The last layer of the encoder is called the bottleneck, which contains the input representation f(x).</li>
<li>The decoder: produces a reconstruction of the input data r = g(f(x)) using the encoding in the bottleneck.</li>
